# **Hostel Management System Installation and Configuration**

## **Installation Steps (Configuration)**

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   Open your terminal, navigate to the desired directory, and run the following command:  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the GitHub repository.

2. **Extract the Files:**  
   If the repository is cloned as a compressed `.zip` file, extract it using any archive tool (e.g., WinRAR, 7-Zip, or built-in extractor). Ensure the folder structure remains intact after extraction.

3. **Place the Project in the Server Directory:**  
   After extracting the files, locate the `hostel` folder. Copy the entire folder and place it in the `xampp/htdocs/` directory on your local machine.

4. **Database Configuration:**  
   - Open **phpMyAdmin** in your browser (usually accessible at `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`).  
   - Create a new database named `hostel`.  
   - Import the provided SQL file `hostel.sql` from the repository into the `hostel` database.

5. **Run the Application:**  
   - Open your browser.
